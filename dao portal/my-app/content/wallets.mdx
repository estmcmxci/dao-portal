## DAO Operational Contracts

The ENS DAO maintains several operational contracts responsible for the collection, custody, and management of protocol revenue and treasury assets. These wallets are integral to the protocol’s on-chain architecture and governance operations.

* **Controller (`controller.ens.eth`)** — Primary contract that collects ETH from `.eth` name registrations and renewals.
* **ENS Wallet (`wallet.ensdao.eth`)** — Main treasury wallet holding DAO funds across ETH, USDC, and ENS tokens.
* **Legacy Controller (`0x283A…B7F5`)** — Previous version of the registration controller, still holding legacy funds from historical operations.

These contracts represent the financial backbone of ENS DAO’s on-chain economy, routing registration income and treasury disbursements into the DAO’s governance system.


## Working Group Multisigs

ENS DAO’s day-to-day activities are administered through **Working Group (WG) multisigs**. Each WG has a distinct purpose, budget, and signer set composed of elected stewards and secretaries. The multisigs are responsible for allocating resources, funding proposals, and executing DAO-approved initiatives.

### Ecosystem Working Group

* **Main Multisig (`main.eco.wg.ens.eth`)** — Oversees general Ecosystem operations, including grants, integrations, and contributor payments.
* **IRL Sub-Multisig (`irl.eco.wg.ens.eth`)** — Handles real-world event and community engagement expenses.
* **Hackathons Sub-Multisig (`hackathons.eco.wg.ens.eth`)** — Manages sponsorships and rewards for hackathon participation.
* **Newsletter Sub-Multisig (`newsletter.eco.wg.ens.eth`)** — Funds content creation, contributor payments, and DAO communications.

### Meta-Governance Working Group

* **Main Multisig (`main.mg.wg.ens.eth`)** — Manages governance tooling, coordination between working groups, and initiatives like bylaws or process improvements.
* **Stream Multisig (`stream.mg.wg.ens.eth`)** — Supports continuous funding streams and operational disbursements between Meta-Gov and other DAO entities.

### Public Goods Working Group

* **Main Multisig (`main.pg.wg.ens.eth`)** — Directs grants and funding toward open-source projects and public goods aligned with ENS’s mission.
* **Large Grants Multisig (`largegrants.pg.wg.ens.eth`)** — Administers larger-scale or recurring public goods grants beyond the scope of regular WG disbursements.


## Governance Summary

Each multisig:

* Operates under a **3-of-4 or 2-of-3** signer policy for transaction execution, depending on its scope and sensitivity.
* Includes both **Stewards** and a **Secretary** to maintain accountability and transparency.
* Publishes all transactions on-chain, with activity verifiable through dashboards like [enswallets.xyz](https://enswallets.xyz) and Etherscan.

Together, these wallets and multisigs form the **financial and administrative infrastructure** of the ENS DAO — ensuring secure custody, transparent funding, and decentralized operational control across all working groups.
